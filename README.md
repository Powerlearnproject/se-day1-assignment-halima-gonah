#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software by applying engineering principles and systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach.
Importance of Software Engineering;
a)	Quality Assurance: Software engineering ensures reliability and efficiency of software products to meet user requirements and reduce the risk of software failures, which can be costly and damaging to businesses.
b)	Scalability: Software that is well-engineered can be scaled to accommodate growing numbers of users and increased data loads hence easy expansion of businesses. 
c)	Cost-Effectiveness & Time Management: Systematic processes helps in managing development costs, identifying and mitigating risks early in the development process, thereby reducing the overall cost of software production and ensuring projects are delivered on schedule which is key in competitive environments.
d)	Driving Innovation: A well-structured approach to development allows teams to experiment and innovate complex and innovative software solutions that can drive technological advancements and create new business opportunities.
e)	Enabling Digital Transformation: Businesses across all industries rely on software to automate processes, improve efficiency, and enhance customer experiences. Software engineering is essential for enabling this digital transformation.
f)	Maintainability: Software engineering practices make it easier to update and maintain software, ensuring that it remains functional and relevant over time

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) The Software Crisis of the 1960s: Projects in the 1960s routinely went beyond budget, schedule, and user requirements as software systems became increasingly complicated. The need of a systematic, engineering approach to software development was brought to light by this "software crisis." The base for formal software engineering practices was established by the early conferences and research sparked by the issue.

b) The Waterfall Model and Structured Programming (1970s–1980s):
The software crisis posed issues that led to the emergence of structured programming methodologies. These methodologies fostered systematic design and concise, modular code. Through specified phases including requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance, teams can more effectively handle complexity and enhance quality with the help of the waterfall model, a sequential design process that was created to provide a disciplined framework for software development.

c) The Agile Revolution (Late 1990s-2001):
The traditional approaches, like the waterfall methodology, found challenging to adjust to evolving requirements as projects became even more dynamic. As a result, agile methodologies were developed emphasizing flexibility, iterative development, and continuous feedback. By emphasizing teamwork and customer responsiveness, the Agile Manifesto, which was published in 2001, revolutionized the way teams design, create, and deliver software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Planning: establishing the project's objectives, scope,viability and creating a project plan, estimating resources, and identifying stakeholders. 

b) Requirements Analysis: Gather and document the detailed requirements of the software including understanding user needs, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security)

c) Design: Create a blueprint, including architecture and design specifications.

d) Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code based on the design.

e) Testing: Verify the software works as intended, meets requirements and is free of defects.

f) Deployment: Release the software for end-users.Involves installing the software on servers or deploying it to app stores.

g) Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, updates, and bug fixes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential and linear approach to software development in which there is barely any overlap between stages and each must be finished before the next one starts.
Agile is a software development methodology that is incremental and iterative. It focuses on delivering tiny, useful software increments, flexibility, and customer collaboration.
Comparison;
a) Planning and Documentation: Both require upfront planning and documentation—Waterfall does it extensively at the beginning, while Agile incorporates it iteratively.
b) Phased Development - Both methodologies involve phases that cover the entire software development lifecycle, from conception to deployment and maintenance.
c) Testing and Quality Assurance - Both methodologies emphasize the importance of testing  and quality control to ensure software quality.
d) Team Collaboration - Both methodologies involve collaboration among team members, though the nature and intensity of collaboration differ.
e) Goal Orientation: Both methodologies aim to deliver high-quality software that meets customer requirements.
Contrast;
a) Waterfall has a Linear and sequential tructure where each phase is completed before the next begins while Agile's structure is Iterative and incremental; work is divided into small increments with regular reviews and adjustments.
b) Agile is highly flexible and can easily adapt to changing requirements and evolving project scopes while Waterfall has Low Flexibility hence changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
c) Waterfall has minimal Customer Involvement, mainly  Customer Involvement occurs the beginning and end of the project while in  Agile Customer Involvement is Continuous throughout the project.
d) Waterfall has Extensive documentation while in agile, documentation is minimal.
e)  Waterfall methodology is best for projects with well-defined, stable requirements and regulatory or contractual constraints whereas Agile is best for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements and where rapid delivery of functional software is needed.
Examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile: Appropriate for startup products where user feedback and market changes require frequent adjustments and also in Mobile app development.
Waterfall: Appropriate for manufacturing processes and construction projects where projects havewell-defined requirements and changes are unlikely.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing, refining, and optimizing the input text (prompts) provided to AI models in order to generate desired and accurate responses.
Importance in interacting with AI models
a) Improves Response Quality:
A well-crafted prompt can lead to more precise and contextually appropriate responses, reducing ambiguity and improving overall quality.

b) Enhances Efficiency:
By effectively communicating the task or question, prompt engineering saves time and minimizes the need for iterative corrections.

c) Tailors Outputs:
It allows users to shape the tone, style, and detail level of the AI’s response, making it more aligned with specific needs or applications.

d) Mitigates Bias and Errors:
Thoughtfully designed prompts can help minimize the propagation of biases or incorrect assumptions in AI outputs.

e) Facilitates Complex Tasks:
For intricate problems or creative tasks, prompt engineering helps in breaking down the problem and guiding the AI through multi-step reasoning.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Write something about ladies."
Improved Prompt:
"Write a 150-word article highlighting the contributions of influential women in the technology industry, focusing on their achievements, challenges, and impact on innovation."
Explanation:

Specific Topic: Instead of the broad term "ladies," the improved prompt specifies "influential women in the technology industry," providing a clear focus.
